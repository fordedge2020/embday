<center><h1>Happy birthday Em!!</h1>
<p>Em!!! Thank you ah sa lahat ng memories na gawa natin during the whole gr9, it was an experience being your seatmate for 1st quarter tapos kaharap kita nung 4th. Pagnaaalala ko ung mga kalokohan natin, napapatawa ako HSHSHS. i coded this ironically kasi alam ko na ako lagi ung naghehelp sayo sa ict. At tbh, willing naman me behind all the teasing (LOL)
<br />
<br />
Anyways, have lots of cake and get a lot of bday wishes, okay? it's a special event once a year so you really deserve it. about kay J, i'm rooting for both of you, coincidence nga na kalapit birthday niyo HAHAHAH deserve mo maging happy, you only get to experience being 16 once so enjoy your year and future years to come. 
<br />
<br />
Wala ako masabi sayo, true friend ka talaga. when im in doubts, nawawala kaagad dahil alam ko totoo kang kaibigan. Well, special day mo today so feel free to ask me to do anything and maybe i'll do it !! And again, Happy birthday, Em. 
<br />
<br />
This school year wouldn't be complete without you, just a reminder that me and your other friends, family cherish and appreciate you very much. Napasaya mo kami, napaiyak mo kami, nainis mo kami. also, sorry in advance
